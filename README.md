# recSOL - Liquid Staking Token (RECTOR SOL)

Welcome to the **recSOL** repository! This project introduces the Liquid Staking Token (LST), **$recSOL**, which empowers users to stake Solana ($SOL) while retaining liquidity and earning rewards seamlessly.  

---

## Overview  

The **recSOL** token represents staked SOL on the Solana blockchain, providing a mechanism to earn staking rewards while maintaining liquidity.  

### Key Features:  
- **Yield Accrual**: Over time, the value of recSOL relative to SOL increases. This is due to staking rewards being added to the pool, which benefits all recSOL holders.  
  - For example, if you hold 1 recSOL today, it will represent more SOL in the future as rewards are distributed to the staking pool.  
- **Liquidity**: Use your recSOL tokens freely in DeFi protocols while earning staking rewards.  
- **Decentralization**: Powered by the secure and efficient Solana blockchain.

**How it works**:  
- When you stake SOL to mint recSOL, your SOL is delegated to validators that earn staking rewards.  
- These rewards are continuously added to the staking pool, increasing the SOL backing each recSOL.  
- This means the recSOL/SOL ratio will grow over time, reflecting the accumulation of staking rewards.  

By holding recSOL, you're automatically compounding your staking rewards without any additional action required.
